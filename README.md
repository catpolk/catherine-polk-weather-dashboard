* Catherine-Polk-weather-dashboard

- My motivation was to create a weather dashboard that would show a weather forecast for a current day and for 5 future days.

- I built this project by using Open Weather On Call API, JS, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. 

- This weather-dashboard allows a user to stay informed about weather conditions for 6 days including current day; it allows to make plans, dress, plan activities according to the weather conditions. 

- I learned how to use fetching API, and how to use the results from the server on my web page, so users can read data and stay informed. I learned how to manipulate data from the server (the data I fetched) and elegantly show it on the webpage. 

- My project stands out becasue it is easy to use; it is very intuitive weather dashboard where a user can find weather forecast for 6 days. My project stands out becasue it saves the search data in local storage, so the user isn't required ti search the same cities again to get the weather, they simply can just click on the city in the list below the search bar.
